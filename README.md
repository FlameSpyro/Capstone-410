## Topic Selection
So far for my capstone one of the first ideas I would like to pursue further would be research. and security simulation of the software security onion. When I met with an employee of a company called Mimecast they suggested the idea for a topic and while im still developing which aspect I would like to pursue this is where I would like t start.
Another route I might potentially tackle is the Ethical Hacking Target Developer with Mackenzie M. as a client. I have been interested in Ethical hacking as a concept ever since I started going to school here and potentially making it the key component and where this could go intrest me a ton!
